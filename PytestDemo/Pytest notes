# Any pytest file should start with a test_
# pytest method names should start with test_
# Each method is a different testcase
# No two testcases can have same test names.(Method names)
# Method name must make sense according to the module to be tested(testcase_name).
# -k stands for method name execution, -s : logs in output, -v : more info metadata.

# Marker tags such as [smoke,sanity,regression] and run them as :
To mark :
@pytest.mark.smoke in testcases method
pytest -m smoke -v -s
pytest -m sanity -v -s
pytest -m regression -v -s

#To skip a test [In case a bug is present in a particular testcase]
@pytest.mark.skip

#To run instead of skipping [maybe output is input to another testcase]
But in output, no reporting as FAIL in logs.
@pytest.mark.xfail

# To create HTML reports
pytest --html reports.html

# Fixtures : For test setup and teardown methods.
@pytest.fixture

# conftest.py file contains all fixtures and makes it available to all test files.

# datadriven and parameterization can be done with return statements in tuple format.

# when we define fixture scope to class only , then it will run only once when class is
initiated and at the end.
